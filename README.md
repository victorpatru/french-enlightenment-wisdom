### How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript

* Curated and placed into an array some of Voltaire's best quotes
* Set up an integration with Twitter to allow the user to tweet a quote from our application
* Set up event listeners, basic DOM, and CSS manipulations to dynamically adjust the content displayed to our users

### Optimizations

* Fetch from a publicly available API so to increase the number of unique quotes displayed to our user 


### Lessons Learned:

* How to read the Twitter documentation to take advantage of built-in functionality that allows our user to tweet the quote from their account


### Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
